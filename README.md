# Diabetes_prediction
This project predicts diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on medical data, analyzing features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age to classify whether an individual is diabetic or not. The goal is to provide a simple and accurate tool for early diabetes detection.
